# Enron_POI
The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model to detect if or not a person has committed fraud based on Enron data.</br>

• Explored the Enron dataset for distributions, correlations, outliers and conducted data cleaning and feature engineering. </br>
• Built machine learning models using Scikit-Learn to predict "Person of Interest" (those who committed fraud).</br>
• Tuned numerous hyperparameters for the models including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM for best performance using Pipeline and cross-validation.</br>
• Evaluated the performance of the trained models in the test dataset and selected the final model having both the precision and recall greater than .3.</br>
